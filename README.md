# Number-of-ordered-set-of-chars-in-a-string
Ordered set of chars means that for example. <br/>
In the string s: XAMXAMXAXM and the word:MAX, s is "alternatively" ordered and the number of occurences is 2. <br/>
I left prints on purpose in my code so anybody can see much better what happens.
For s: XAMXAMXAM and the word MAX , number of occurences is 0. <br/>
For s: MMMAAAXXX and the word MAX, number of occurences is 3. <br/>
For s: MAXMAXMAX and the word MAX, number of occurences is 3. <br/>
For s: XXXAAAMMM and the word MAX, number of occurences is 1. <br/>
